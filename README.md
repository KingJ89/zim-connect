ZimConnect Shopping Cart - Documentation

Project Overview

ZimConnect is an e-commerce platform designed to provide users with a seamless online shopping experience . connecting suppliers in southafrica to buyers in zimbabwe. This documentation outlines the development process, challenges faced, deployment, installation, testing, and system specifications for the project.

Challenges Faced

Embarking on an ambitious project like ZimConnect came with a series of challenges:

1. Integrating Frontend and Backend

Ensuring smooth communication between the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and the backend (Node.js and Express) was particularly challenging. Issues arose with CORS errors, mismatched API endpoint structures, and asynchronous data handling.

2. Dynamic Data Handling

Populating dynamic data in the shopping cart and ensuring real-time updates for actions like adding, removing, and updating items posed significant challenges.

3. User Experience (UX) Design

Crafting an intuitive user interface while maintaining responsiveness across various devices required thorough iterations and user feedback.

4. Error Handling

Implementing proper error messages and fallback mechanisms for API failures, invalid user inputs, and server downtime.

5. Backend Stability

Structuring the backend to handle multiple user requests efficiently and securely was another significant hurdle.

6. Deployment Complexities

Ensuring the application worked as intended on production servers while maintaining database connectivity and environment-specific configurations.
